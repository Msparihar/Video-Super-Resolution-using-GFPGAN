## Steps to Use the Colab Notebook

1. **Upload Video:**

   - Open the provided Colab notebook in your Google Colab environment.
   - Run the notebook cell that handles video uploads.

2. **GFPGAN Video Upscaling:**

   - Run the cell that uses GFPGAN to upscale the video frames.
   - The script extracts frames from the uploaded video, upscales each frame using GFPGAN, and saves the enhanced frames.

3. **Download Enhanced Video:**

   - After GFPGAN processing is complete, the enhanced video frames are available in the specified output directory.
   - Download the upscaled video directly from the Colab environment.

4. **Compare Sample Images:**
   - The `comparison` folder contains two sample images: one before GFPGAN upscaling and the other after.
   - View and compare these images to observe the enhancement achieved by GFPGAN.
